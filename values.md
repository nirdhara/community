# Values

These are the fundamental beliefs and principles that we must uphold.

**See people as people**

View all individuals, whether they're customers or contributors of the platform, as unique people with their own goals and difficulties. Engage in supporting and collaborating with them proactively, demonstrating an outward mindset that prioritizes their needs and success.

**Customer first**

Begin with the customer's needs and build towards technology, focusing on earning and maintaining their trust. To find the right solution, first define the problem accurately.

**Long term game & ownership**

Take ownership, focusing on lasting success over quick wins. Support the entire team, not just your part, and let go of "that's not my job" thinking.

**Self-imposed constraints & frugality**

Utilize self-imposed limitations to drive inventive problem-solving and innovation. By doing more with less, promote self-reliance and resourcefulness.

**10x Thinking**

Limiting your thoughts leads to limited outcomes. Establish and share a courageous vision that sparks achievements. Approach challenges uniquely and seek innovative ways to meet customer needs.
